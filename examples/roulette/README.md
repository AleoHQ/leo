# Leo roulette

## Summary

A simple implementation of the popular casino game roulette in Leo.

## Disclaimer

This is a toy example, the random number is generated in a deterministic way through a seed. 
The seed is equal to the roulette spin counter number.

The random number is generated by applying the Poseidon Hash Function available in Aleo Instructions 
to the seed and then applying mod(36) to the last 6 bits. 
This mod operation is performed outside the circuits and then verified within them. 

## How to Run

### Build Guide

To compile this program, run:
```bash
leo build
```

### Run Guide
Modify the inputs in `inputs/roulette.in`


First, generate a new casino for a new roulette game.
```
leo run mint_casino_token_record
```

Next, run the hash function to determine the seed for the roulette spin.

```
leo run psd_hash
```

Take the last 6 bits of the output and apply mod(36).
To verify that you have the correct number, modify `inputs/roulette.in` and run
```
leo run psd_bits_mod
```

Lastly, calculate the wins and losses by running
```
leo run make bet
```
